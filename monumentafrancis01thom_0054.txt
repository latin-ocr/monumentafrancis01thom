bui] 111611· number and 111611· mnallness are indicative of 1116
class froin whom they were received, and of 1116 popu-
lariby of 1116 friars. The regisber of 111611· convent in
London might, be accepted aa* a specimen of 111611·
general breabnienb without furbher evidence. But Eccle-
Sbon is precise on this point. At Canterbury 1116 master
of 1116 Priest’s hospital gave 1116 corporabion a piece of
ground and a chapel scr 1116 use of 1116 f1·iars.¹ At Oxford
Richard de Muliner gave 1116 corporation a house and
piece of ground for 111611· use. At Cambridge 1116 burgesses
received 1116111 and assigned 1116111 a decayed church
near 1116 town gaol. At Shrewsbury 1116 king gave
1116 ground, 1116 burgesees 1116 buildings. In ‘ohese and
in other instances 1116 pracbice prevailed of invesbing
money, land, and buildings for 1116 use of 1116 friars,
in 1116 corporations of 1116 101ν116; and 1116 reason is
