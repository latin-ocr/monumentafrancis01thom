of the learned in the law, and on the strength of Apostolical nu-

our Lord the Bishop of Lincoln has a privilege from the See Apos->
tolie whereby he is exempted from providing for any one by apos-
tolical mandate, except there be special mention made of the pri-
vilege. But in the tenor of this Papa] mandate, which 1110 1010511111
John relies on, and by reason of which he has, with your aid, 11111151
himself into the said church, there is no mention of such a privi-
lege. Therefore, the Bishop of Lincoln is not bound in this case
to answer him, specially in the collation of the Church of 'l'ha1ne,

dignity.’ When the aforesaid John had heard this, as well as the
King and his councillors, he said, ‘My Lord the King‚ far be it
that dise-ord or disturbance should arise 011 my account between such
noble personages. I patiently resign my right. The Lord will at
his good pleasure provide sufficient-ly for me so long as you are

alive.' '' ¹

The chronicler then proceeds to state that, as the King delaycd
compliance on his return to London, Grostete made his appearance,
ready to pronounce sentence of excommunication upon Mansel and
his adherents. Upon which the latter, in great terror, absolutely
resigned the living of Thame into the hands of the King. This
must be the resignation to which Adam de Marisco refers. Here-
