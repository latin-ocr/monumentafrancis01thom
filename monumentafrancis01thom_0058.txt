xlvi PREFACE.
doubtedly, when the Order degenerated, the friar com-
bined with his spiritual functionS, the occupation of ped-
161, 1161116131 mountebank, and quack doctor 3 and the vice
of oovetousness, os which he was too frequently accusffl,
led him to elnploy his skill in driving bargains to his
own advantage. But a just 6511111616 of the importance
of the Order must not 116 taken from its decline, or the
representations of its enemies. The monks were jealous
of the learning and popularity of the friar 3 the bishops
hated him 65 refusing defer-enee to their authority3 the
Lollards regarded him 65 the bitter champion of ortho-
doxy, 651116 unserupulous persecutor of 611 who dissented
from the traditions and teaching of Rome. A careful
perusal of Eccleston's work, and 6 candid review of
the history of the friars, will justify the praise bestowed
upon them by Lord Baoon,² and vindicate the historical
aocuracy of the sketch whioh 6 philosopher, greater than
Bacon himself, has left in his portraiture of the friar in
Romeo and Juliet.3

¹ Thus in Chaucer the friar is de-
scribed as having his mantle stuck

at his cell door, as he comcs forth
with a basket at early morn to collect

with hardware like a tramper :—
“His tippet was ay farsud ful of
knyfes
And pinnes for to give faire
wyfes.’'
And in thc Lollard poem published
at the end of this volume, p. 592.
² Essay X.

³ The character of the Friar is ζ

historically correct 111 its minutest
particulars. It shows, notwithstand-
ing the prejudices of his age, how
shakespeare caught the prominent
features of the Order in the indi--
vidual‚ and brought them out to the
gaze of his readers, unsullied by the
base alloy in which the weakncss
or caprices of men had invested it.
In the speech of Friar Lawrence

 

simples, we see how intimately the
meditation of ‘the friar was con-

nected with the study of nature ;- =

‘⁶ O meikle is the powerful grace

that lies

In herbs‚ plants, stones, and their
true qualities.

For nought so vile that on the
earth doth live

But to the earth some special
good doth give,-

Nor ought so good, but strained
from that fair use,

Revolts from true birth, stumbling
on abuse.

Virtue itself turns vice, being mis-
applied,

And vice sometimes by action
dignified.’'
