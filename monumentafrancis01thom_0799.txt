the neighbourhood that the official was at Laniheth, near London,
they hurried off there in a body, and wrenehing the gates from
their hinges and battering them down with lovers, lhev luy violent
hands on the official, as he was sitting down to dinner, never
anticipating any such proceeding, and drag him off, like th.-
vilest offender taken in a larceny, and set him on a seui-vv
horse and carry him off at their pleasure3 not so much as allow-
ing him to hold the bridle. Oh, rash. presumption, oh, inexcu-
sable irrevereme, to treat and vex with so much ignominy so
authentic a man, so excellently learned, so clearly famous ; above
all, one who was the representative of the Arc-hbishop! ss
So after they had done all that their anger, or rather surv.
suggested, they dragged off the official hythe bridle to Farnhaiii,
until they should be certified of the restitution of the prior.
At length they let him go. He is driven away as a caitifl‘. The
official, though an old man, slew away like a bird to Walerlee
[Waverley ?], a Cistercian house, rejoicing for that time that he had
escaped their crooked and hooked hands and elaws, without during
to look behind him, lest he should suffer the (loom of Lot’s wife.
And when the monks saw him they marvelled what mishap could
have driven him there a solitary and a fugitive. There he took
breath and received consolation.

The party of the Archbishop who had received this wrong lodged
a heavy complaint before the Archbishop of this presumption, with
many sighs and tears, exaggerating great offences into greater. ancl
of grave ones making still graver. Stirred wilh anger more than
I can tell you, the Archbishop exelaims: “ These are sharp tidings
“ on my first arrival :²⁹ then taking with him the Bishops of Chichester
and Hereford, he started for London. There with the two mentioned
bishops in full pontificals, in the presence of an innumerahle
assemblage of people summoned to attend by the voice of tho
crier, thirty days’ indulgence being granted to those who came, the
Archbishop excommunicated, in St. Mary the Arehes, with excessivo
horror and solemnity, all the contrivers and abettors of this rash
act, except our Lord the King, and the Queen, with ‘their children,
Earl Richard, the countess his wife, and their children. And he
wrote besides to all his suffragans in virtue of their obedience to
the see of Canterbury, strictly charging them to do the same in

their churches every Sunday and holiday.

On the other side the Bishop elect of Winchester commanded
the Dean of Southwark and some others of his subjeets to with-
stand the Archbishop and denounce to his face that his excommu-
nication was null and void. “ Yes,'’ said he, “it is empty and
“ frivolous, and in the wrong-doer a mere foxlike shuffle.''
