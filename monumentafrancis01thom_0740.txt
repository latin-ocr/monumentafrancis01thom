IX.

Ordimmces for the lcousehold of Bishop Grostete.

(From the Sloane MS. 1986. f. 193. vell.)

THOUGH entitled Ordinanees for the Household 'of
Bishop (hostete, this is evidently a Letter addressed
to the Bishop on the management of his Household
by some very intimate friend. From the terms used
in the Letter‚ it is clear that the writer must have
been on confidenti-al terme with the Prelate. I cannot

affirm positively that the writer was Adam de Mariseo, Ἴ

although to 110 other would this document be attri-
buted with greater probabssity. No one else enjoyed
such a degree of Grostete’s affection 3 none would have

ventured to address him with so much familiarity.
Resides, the references made more than once by Adam ἓ,
(16 Marisoo 111 his letters to the management of the ’

Bishop's househokl, greatly strengthen this supposition.
See pp. 160. 170.

The MS. is a. small quarto 011 1761111111, 111 1116 writing
of the 15tl1 century. 11 is 111 all probability a transla-
tion from a Latin original.
