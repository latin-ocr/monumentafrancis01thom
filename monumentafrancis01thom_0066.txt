For evil.

liv PREFACE.

No one will accuse Aristotlc of mysticism; no 0110
will for a moment imagine that the high priest 01
00111111011 sense is ever 111 danger of losing sight of the
obvious and the litera] in the allegorica] meaning
of words. The rigid circumscriber of ternus, approach-
ing his definitions by a rigorous, though not very
profimnd, indue-tion of their usage, etymologies‚ and
analogies‚ was not likely to give much countenance
to an interpretation of Scripture² which turned the
plainest‘ facts of history into the most fanciful alle-
gories, and accepted that exposition as the truest
which was the furthest removed from the literal mean-
ing. As the schoohnan was forced by his position on
the necessity of rigid demonstration and an exacter use
of words, he derived from the study of the great
logie-ian a more natural and 111-,01111 exposition of Scrip-
11110, a desire sor more caresul versions and com-
mentaries. We date from this time a more me-
thodical treatment of all subjects under discussion;
the employment of words 111 their more strict and literal
meaning 3 a work as new to the thirteenth century as it
was important for the crdtivation of those habits of accu-
rate observaffion, without which the sixteenth century
would have been as hazy‚ erratio, and immethodical
as the 11111111 01 1110 tenth. Let the reader who is
inclined to under-rate this service to truth refer to any
commentary upon the plainest portions of Scripture
before and subsequent to the schoolmen.

Out of this precision and the consequent necessity of
stating and arranging foi-mally in a certain number of
propositions every subject under discussion, sprang their
great err0r3 but it is not one of which this age has

any right to accuse them. Their faults arose from .

forced upon them3 it was adapted to their audience
and the state of science in their 111110; if the syllo-
gistic process be, as Bacon declares, the natural method
