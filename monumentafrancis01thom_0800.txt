However‚ the Archbishop treasuring up the fire of his hate
under its ashes, as Master Eustace‚ who was more hurt and more
indignant, instigated him to revenge for so enormous a transgression,
directed his steps to Oxford, and summoning a convocation of all
the scholars then resident there from all parts, he propounded to
them publicly this nefarious act seriatim ,· that by their reports an
offence so enormous might not be hidden even from distant
nations. As he approached the town there went out to meet him
on high horseS‚ in their best array, an innumerable multitude of
the clergy, doing honor, as they ought, to an archbishop and
primate of all England. And as he sat down to a sumptuous dinner

passed on them before—Mat. Paris, in an. 1252.

convent there, an order notoriously unfriendly to the friars.

“ I have received,'’ he sayS, “ a letter apostolic, to the effect, that
on the authority therein contained, I should have the buildings of
the Minorites of Scarborough demolished, if they be of such a
nature as is described in the aforesaid letter. I have accordingly
summoned the friars, and on their appearing by proxy legally con-
stituted, before my official acting on my behalf, during two days'
litigation, it was objected on their part against the said letter
that there was a flaw in its construction, and they exhibited a
faculty (privileyium) to the effect that the friars could not be con-
vented by letters apostolic except express mention were made of
the said indulgence, and of their order. After much altercation
on these and other points, on the third day the friars appeared
by their proctor before me sitting in my own person, and one of
their order said as follows: That although, notwithstanding their
profession, they thought they might innocently defend them-
selves in this behalf, by contending that they were supporting
