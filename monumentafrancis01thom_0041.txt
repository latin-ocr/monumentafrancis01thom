PREFACE. xxix

barefizmted, begging his broad ssom house to house, the
voluntary poverty of the friat removed the scandal
under which Christianity laboured froin the excesses
and the superfluities of its privileged teachers.

But the poverty thus strictly enjoined had another
and not less important object. It was intended to
prevent the friars from giving themselves up to the
popular studies of the age. Logic and the canon
law monopolised the clergy. The example of Abelard
had found numerous admirers; little suited, however,
for the requirements os the age.

What beneficia] effects could dialectie subtleties or
disputations at the Universities exercise over the hearts
and actions of men engaged in the real battle of life?
Possibly the secular training and occupations of St.
Francis in his earlier years may have kept him from
those ecclesiastica] influences under which he must of
necessity have fallen, had he at first proposed to 111111-
self 1110 career of a preacher against heresy like 1110
Dominican. He had 110 temptation 10 magnify pursuits
in which the clergy of his days universally engaged;
he must have seen how little suited they were for his
Order‚ how little calculated 10 accominsh the object he
desired. Therefore he set his face against learning3
he would have his followers like the poor, 1101 111 dress
only, but in heart and understanding. Total, actual
poverty secured this; it was incompatible with the
possession of books, or the necessary materials for study.
When the stringency of the rule had been in some
measure relaxed‚ much of its ancient severity remained.
Roger Bacon had to carry on his researches and ex-
periments without books, or instruments, except what
he could procure from his friends. He tells the Pope,
to whom he dedicated his works, that he possessed no
MSS„ that he was not 1101111111οᾶ 1110 use of ink or
parchment, that nothing but a distinct order from his
Holiness could dispense with the stringency of the rule.
