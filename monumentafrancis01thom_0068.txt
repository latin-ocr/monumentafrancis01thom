“ 1110111 and bend them and break them 111 your plea-
“ sure; so that, as was said of Seneca, Verborum 'mi-
“ nuidis reo-um franyz't pondera, so a man may truly
⁴⁴ say of the schoolmen, Qnoestisonum ‘indomitis scien-
“ tauram frma 911111 soliditatem. For were it not better
for a man in 11 fair room to 001 up one great light
‘⁶ or branching candlestick of lights than to go about
“ with a small watch-candle into every corner? And
“ such is their method, that rests not so much upon
‘⁶ evidence of truth proved by arguments, authorities,
“ similitudeS, examples, as upon particular confutations
“ and solutions of every scruple‚ cavillation, and ob-
⁴‘ ι10011011, breeding for the most part one question as
‘¹ fast as it solveth another3 even as on the former re-
“ semblance, when you carry the light into one corner
“ you dai-ken the rest3 so that the fable and fiction of
“ Scylla seemeth to be a lively image of this kind of
‘⁶' philosophy or knowledge, which was transformed into
⁴¹ a comely virgin for the upper parts, but then can-
“ <lida succinctam {amazonibus ’ἱνὶῃαῖῡία monstris;
“ 00 1110 generalities of schoolmen are for a while good
‘⁴ and proportionable3 but then when you descend
“ into their distinctions and divisions, instead of a
“ fruitful womb for the use and benefit of man's life,
“ they end in inonstrous altercations and barking ques-
“ 110110. So as it is 1101 possible but this quality of
“ knowledge must fall under popular contempt, 1110 1
“ people being apt to contemn truth upon occasion of
‘⁶ controversies and altercations, and 10 think they are Ἴ
·‘ all out of their way which never meet, and when
“ they see such digladiation about subtleties and matter
“ of no use or moment, they easily fall upon that „
“ judgment of Dionysius of Syracuse: Verba ista sunt <
“ senum otiosoomm.

“ N otwithstanding‚ certain it is that if those school- ε.
“ men to their great thirst of truth and unwearied Ὗ
“ trave] of wit had joined variety and unive1·sality·⁴
