PREFACE. lxix

and must rather be corrected by the car than by the
eye. As the scribe wrote to dictation, the omission of
a word, or a lnisapprehension of its sound, was often
productive of eri-ors. But the confusion in the punctu-

pose that the MS. was coinpiled and written in Oxford.
Among his correspondents were the Queen of England,
