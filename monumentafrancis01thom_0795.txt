HUGH MORTIMER.
See p. 298.

This Hugh Mortimer was first, as Ι said, official of Canterhury‚
“ Boniface being Archbishop elect, and taking ship to go for Rome,
“ commanded the woods belonging to his archbishopric to be cut
“ down and sold, and certain taxes and iinpositions to be levied

“ of the Provinee of Poitou, his official, who diligently executed
“ his commands.'' He continued official very long, it seems, for

cellor or vicar-general to the Archbishop; for in the year 1253
he sends his mandate of induction to the Archdeacon’s official for
the inducting the Abbot of St. Radegund into the parsonage of
Alcham. Afterwards, to wit, about the year 1271, he became arch-
deacon, which place he held about fourteen years. Archbishop
Boniface died 1270, at which time Hugh Mortimer was in possession
of the archdeaconry, and had been so (as is most probable) two
years before the death of that archbishop. . . . Ι11 which time,

of St. Margaret in Canterbury, with consent of the patron, the
Abbot of St. Austin's. . . His challenging of this and the like
power, in the time of the vacancy‚ begat a quarrel between 111111
