and deelining, like the older Ortler& to confine themselves

They are accused of studying eloquenee and the art
of rhetorio in the composition of their sermons, of
making their addresses agreeable to the people‚ of
communicating with seeular persons, of derogating froin
the dignity of the clerieal office and bringing a scandal
on the Ohurch. And, undoubtedly, not only the matter
and style of their teaehing, but their dress, their mode

 

Finally in

Ch. XX. He adverts to the rca-
sons which induced him to reply to
these calumnies, and the insinua-
tions thrown out by their opponents
against the previous lives of the
friars. He condemns the sweeping
calumnies directed against the whole
body drawn from the loose examples
of a few, the hasty inference that
the friars were false apostles‚ because
they sought more luxurious hos-
pices, in which they might be more
comfortably entertained, and inter-
meddled in other men’s business in
order to gain property. In

Ch. XXI. The insinuations
against the sincerity of the friars‚ as
if they sought the favour of the
world and not the good of mankind.
Ile condemns also the uncharitable
anticipation of God’s judgment, of
which free use had been made by
the Sorbonists, in say-ing that the
friars would eventually become cor-

satisfied with these imputations‚ they
had endeavoured to make the friars

odious to the world, by assertin g th at
they were the false apostles de-

nounced in the primitive chureh,
thieves‚ robbers, and spoilers, who

 

entered houses and wasted the sold,
against whom the church was warn-
ed; the forerunners of Antichrist‚
of which their charity, studies, and
sastings were so many evident signs,
being nothing better than a cloak
sor hypocrisy.

Such a mode of reasoning, though
recommended by the respectable
authority of William of St. Amour‚
and adopted without any suspicion
by modern historiam, would have
seemed monstrous and incredible,
were it not as fashionable in this
nineteenth century as in the thir-
teenth‚ only substituting for the
friars any body of Christians more
than usually active, and therefore
particularly obnoxious. I am sur-
prised to see a late writer repeating
the old and exploded scandal of the
Franciscan John of Parma being
the author of ‘⁶ The Eternal Gospel.''
The University of Paris in their
manifesto against the Mendicants
(De Periculis Ecclesioe), written be-
fore 1256, state positively that this
book had been written fifty-five years
before3 that is, before the Francis-
can Order existed. Ch. viii. See
