the day, for the love of God, of the monks living in that grnngc,
lest they should perish from hunger and the wild beasts in 1116
wood. The portel· told the Prior, who was there with soui- monk-s,

taking them for mummers, and not God's servants, drove them
away reproachfully, and thrust them out of the gates, But the
youngest monk had compassion 011 them, and said to the portur,
