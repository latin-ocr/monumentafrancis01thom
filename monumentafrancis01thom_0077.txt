may have seen such a copy of Ecclestmi, which has
since disappeared with other works of the same kind!
But if so, it is remarkable that, in his account of the
arrival of the F ranciscans in England, and the planting
and diffusion of their order here, Wadding should have
preferred the later and obviously erroneous accounts of
Bartholomew of Pisas-² and the still more modern and
vague narratives of Gonzaga, to the contemporary and
precise information furnished by Eccleston. On various
occasions the testimony of Eccleston would have been of
the greatest service to Waddhrg, in clearing up obscuri-
ties connected With the early history of the Friars.
Eccleston speaks with the fulness and unhesitating
sincerity of an eye-witness, where VVadding is meagre
and unsatisfactory. Is it credible that if Wadding
had really seen the MS. of Eccleston‚ he would have
treated it with so much contempt and apparent indif—
ference? Such a supposition is impossible, considering
the ternis in which he has spoken of Eccleston in his
Bibliotheca.

I infer, therefore, that Wadding’s acquaintance with
Eccleston’s history extended only to the extracts of it
published by Leland and Wood, no further. Even those
he does not appear to have treated with the con-
sideration they deserved. For he trusted implicitly to
Pitts‚ a poor compiler of the thh century.

There seems, then, little hope of recovering a more
perfect or complete copy of Eccleston's work3 and the
extracts made from it by the writers already nien-
tioned are too scanty to yield much help for correcting
the errors and obsciuities of the text. Owing to these
deficiencies and the incompleteness of both MSS„ it
