vation would have 110 meaning if it implied that the
schoohnen were Setting up one authority in the place
of another, Aristotle in thc place of thc Fathcrs.
In truth, Aristotle was a double help to them, not
merely for that logical method of which he was the
master, but,pri1narily, as the exponent of natural
reason, and, secondly, as the representative of the whole
range of Greek, that is, of all philosophy. Whatever
natural reason could do, unassisted by Revelation, that
Aristotle had accomplished. He is the apostle of
man’s natural reason, in all its strength, and if not
in all, at least in 110 small share of its defccts and its
weakness. He is the philos‹1›pher whose final appeal
is to the common sense of mankind, and to their
ordinary words as the expression of their common
saith. It would, perhaps, be too much to say, that
the rudiments of all ancient heresies are to be finnid
actually in the works of Aristotle 3 but they might be
found in the method and principles of Aristotle. Not
without good reason did St. Bernard and the church
of his age feel an instinctive dread at the enthrone-
ment of a science which boded no good to the com-
mon faith of Christendom, and set up natural re-
ligion against revealed, understanding against faith.
But for missionaries like the f1·iars‚ who had to
dispute with men not accustomed to the care, not
wflliug, therefore, to acknowledge the authority of
the church, it was of the utmost importance to know
the full range and freest scope of the natural reason,—
and where was there so clear and satisfactory an
exponent of it as Aristotle2 Whilst against those of
the learned who magnified the Aristotelian philosophy,
and would listen to no other appeal, it afforded the
only weapon.
But this study of Aristotle produced more lasting The re-

and important consequences than the introduction of ἓξὲξ for
his method or even of his philosophy into the schools.
