PREFACE. XXXV

how they could have carried the truths 01 Christianity
to the hearts 01 the ignorant and the poor. By
education unfitted for thc mk, they could know but
little 01 the population whom they had to address3
and their vow 01 celibacy kept them apart from their
flocks. The necessities of the class for whom they

living ancl preaching suitable to his auditory3 110
had to speak to the hearts of men and women who
were not learned3 he had to study those hearts and
what was in them, before he could hope to address
them with success. His poverty enabled him to accom-

those functions which the Clergy could not, and visit
those whom the Clergy found it impossible to visit. A
less formal but not less effective style of preaching
prevailed‚ suited to an audience consisting as much
of women as of men, appealing more directly to the
-feelings 3 more popular and. more dramatic. This is one
of the common accusations brought against the Friars
by the Clergy, partly jealous 01 their new influence,
