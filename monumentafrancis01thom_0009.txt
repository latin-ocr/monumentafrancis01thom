submitted to the Treasury a proposal for the publication
of materials for the History of this Country from the
Invasion of the Romans to the Reign of Henry VIII.

The Master of the Rolls suggested that these materiale
should be selected for publication under competent editors
without reference to periodical or chronological arrange-
ment, without mutilation or abridgment, preference being
given, in the first instance, to such materials as were most

He proposed that each chronicle or historical document
to be edited should be treated in the same way as if the
editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps3 and for this
purpose the most correct text should be formed from an
accurate collation of the best MSS.

To render the work more generally usefnl, the Master
of the Rollss suggested that the editor should give an
account of the MSS employed by him, of their age and
their peculiarities3 that he should add to the work a bri 161
