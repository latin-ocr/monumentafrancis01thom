'There are numerous other indi-
cations in the volume of his sound
and practical good sense. Unlike
the other religious orders, who had
multiplied the rules of asceticism
until they had become an intolerable
snare, St. Francis retained only the
ordinary vigils, and fasts of the
Charch. On other days the friars
had licence to eat flesh or other
food indifferently. St. Francis used
to say that the body was created
for the soul, and the flesh ought
to be subdued to the spirit. The
servant of God ought therefore to
eat, sleep‚ drink‚ and satisfy his
bodily requirements with discretiori,
that the body may have no ocea-
sion of complaining that it can not
stand erect or pay attention to
prayer because its wants are not
satisfied. (Ib. 87.) He was a great
advocate for cheerfulness, saying
that it was the sign of a clean heart,
and a great defence against the devil.
“ Why,” said he to one of his friars‚
“ do you wear that sad and gloomy
countenance because of your offences.
Itis enough that your sorrow should
be known between you and your
God. Pray for His mercy to spare
you, and restore that cheerfulness to
your soul which you have lost by
your own demerits.”

In the following advice on the
choice of a minister-general of the

A man has no more know-

Order, there is the same vein of good
sense and sagacity : “A minister-
general ought to be of irreproach-
able life, of great discretim, spotless
character, and free from partiality‚
lest by showing too great an affec-
tion for one party he bring ascandal
on the whole. He must be studious
in prayer, apportioning certain hours
for his own soul‚ and others to his
flock. He must begin the day with
mass, and with devout obedience
commend himself therein and his
flock to the Divine protection. After
prayers he is to present himself to
his brethren‚ and standing in the
midst of them, he is to hear the
questions of all and reply to all, and
provide for all, with eharity, pa-
tience, and kindness. He is not to
be an acceptor of persons; not to
care less for the simple and unin-
formed than for the learned and the
wise. If he has the gift of know-
ledge, he is all the more to show
himself a pattern of piety and sim-
plicity, of patience and humility.
Let him foster virtue in himself and
others, not ceasing to preach it as-
siduously, attracting others more
by his example than his words. Let
him anathematize money, the chief
corruptor of our profession and per-
fection3 and, therefore, as an example
to be followed by all, let him have
no purse and no coffers. His habit
