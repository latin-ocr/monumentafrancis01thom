“ in reliance upon Him, who 6116 011 1116 throne of
‘⁶ jusssice and judgmenb, if 1116 Earl would be careful
“ of preserving in his own person, his soldiers and
“ servants, and in all belonging 101116 governnient, de-
“ 17011011 10 God, unbroken loyalby, friendship with
“ one another, charity towards all.'’ (p. 261.) In 1111166
of such confusion 11 was 1101 10 be expected 111311 1116
followers would imitate 1116 moderation of 111611· leaders,
or be restrained from imitating excesses pracbised with
impuniby by 111611· opponents. ‘⁴ What, use is 11,” ex-
claims he 10 1116 Earl, ‘⁶ 10 provide for 1116 peace of
“ your fellow·eiffizens, and 1101 guard 1116 peace of your
“ own (10111661106 and your own household2” And
111611 116 adds a cantion which, in De Montfort's case,
was 1101 needless: “ 1361161· 16 a patien‘o man than a
“ strong man, and he who can rule his own 1611111161·
“ ’ohan he who 61011116 a city.'' (p. 264.)¹ At 1116 same
111116 116 does full justice 10 1116 earl's nobler qualities;
10 1116 untiring zeal for 1116 good of 1116 church and
1116 Ρ1016011011 of the oppressed3 10 1116 modesty ; 10
1116 encouragement and favour shown by him towards
all designs for reforming 1116 corruptions of 1116 age,
and securing 1116 freedom of 1116 people. In all 111666
respects 1116 letters of Adam de Marisco confirm 1116
popular estimation in which 1116 Earl was held. When
1116 earl had remonsbrated apparently for 1116 favour-
able 1611116 111 which 1116 writer had spoken of him,
Adam de Marisco answers: “ My conscience does 1101
“ accuse me 011 that, head3 nor have I in 11116, as I
“ conceive, departed from 1116 examples of 1116 wise,

‘This want of moderation in the cause was in some measure owing
Earl, pardonable enough consider- the disunion of his party after the
ing the difficulties of his position, is Battle of Lewes, and his subsequent ἵ
confirmed by too many independent misfortunes. See also the two re-
testimonies, and even by these let- markable letters addressed to his
