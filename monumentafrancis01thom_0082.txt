Cornwall, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishops
of VVinchester and Worcester, Bishop Grostete, the
Franciscan Ministers, and others. The correspondence
extends over several years, and he must at an early
period have entertained the idea of eventually collect-
ing it for publication. This is further evident from
the fact that the names mentioned in some of the
letters have been left blank, as if the writer were un-
willing to let them appear, for political or other
reasons. Unfortunately, no traces of the letters ad-
dressed to the writer is now to be found. Even in
the correspondence of Bishop Grostete, as published by
Brown in his Fasciculus, not a single Epistle appears
addressed to Adam de Marisco, although the letters of
the latter bear evident testimony of the intimate and
unbroken correspondence between himself and the
bishop. I may add, in conclusion, that this MS. is un—
doubtedly the same as the one mentioned by Bishop
Bale (who generally contrives to repeat and augment
the blunders of his predecessors) under the title of
Εῃὶεΐοῖαῑ (ccl Grossetestum; the only work of the
kind which Bale has attributed to Adam de Marisco.¹
