IL—THE STATE AND HISTORY OF THE MSS.

OF the era thus sketched in the foregoing pages, this
volume contains the earliest accounts ς’ scanty and
meagre compared with the importance of the subject,
hut still almost the only contemporary materials we
possess of the settlement and progress of the Franciscan
Friars in England. The history of the order was com-
piled long after its importance had declined. Contem-
porary narratives and letters, ‚such as those which are
exhibited in this volume, are extremely rare. This is
a justification for their appearance among the “Memo-
“ rials and Chronicles of Great Britain.”¹

Valuahle as they are on this account, they have
additional claime on the reader, as they are now for
the first time given to the world. The MSS. from
which they have been derived are unique, and have
narrowly escaped total destruction.

Ι, The treatise of Eccleston De Adventu Minorum
in Amslz'am, Which stands first in the volume, is
found in a mutilated MS„ in the Chapter Library

 

¹ I cannot consider the life of St.
Francis, by his disciple, the cele-
brated cardinal Bonaventura, as
forming any exception to this state-
ment. The pious motive which
dictates the duty of such a tribute
to the memory of a saint and foun-
der of a religious order, is very
different from that which deter-
mines the judgment of an ordinary
biographer or narrator. The Liber
Consorrnitatunz of Bartholomew of
Pisa, the best account we yet

possess of St. Francis and his earliest
companions, notwithstanding its ab·
surdities‚ did not appear until the
close of the 14th century. In this
respect the Franciscans form a re-
markable contrast to the Benedic-
tine monks, and Eccleston might
reasonably regret that, whereas
other orders had their historians,
and their records of great men to·
place before their disciples, the
Franciscan possessed no such means
for glory and edification. See p. 3.
