and the first of that profession who publicly taught theology in
the schools. According to Touron,¹ he succceded Roland of Cre-
mona in the Chair of Theology at Thoulouse about 1231, where
he was exposed to the hostilities of the Albigense53 and shortly
after held the Chair of Theology at Oxford. It was here that he
became acquainted with Grostete, then reader to the Minorite Friars‚
with Robert Bacon and Richard Fishacre. To this account of him,
found in most works which speak of this Order, we can now add
the information furnished by the letters of Grostete and De Marisco.
Among those of 1116 former there 15 611 66111651 supplication to
Jordanus, the Prior General of the Ι)0111111106115,2 111 which the
writer, after mentioning the intimacy existing at ffiford between
himself and the Prior General, proceeds 10 say, “Your charitable
‘⁶ discretionis well aware that our diocese is much larger and more
“ populous than any 011161· 111 England, and thereforeI need more
“ effectual aid in the preaching of God's word, in the hearing of
“ confessione, in the enjoining of penance‚ more prudent counsel in
“ the various and new emergencies which continually start up, a
“ sound and healthy determination according to the meaning of
’ὅ Scripture. I know of no man who can be so effectual a coadjutor
“ in these respects as Friar John de St. Giles, whose soul, per-
“ ceiving my need and great necessity in these respects, is graciously
“ pleased to accede to my requests if it meets with your charitable
“ approval. WVherefore, 61 1116 feet of your benignity, Ι, prostrate,
“ supplicate you with humhle devotion, and adjure you by the
“ sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, and by the compassiou
“ of his beloved Mother, that you would mercifully grant my
“ request, and license Friar John, or rather enjoin him, to help me,
“ a prop to my weakness‚ a supplement to my insufficiency‚ &c.”
This request it seems was complied with. Grostete bestowed
on him the prebend of Leighton (see p. 132) and the archdeaconry
of Oxford (172.) from which preferments 116 requested to be released,
as Adam de Marisco informs the Bishop. He outlived his friend
however3 for Mat. Paris states that in 1253, during his last sickness,
Grostete summoned to his bed-side John de St. Giles, “skilful in
“ medicine, in theology learned and refined‚'' to receive comfort from

him both in body and soul.
