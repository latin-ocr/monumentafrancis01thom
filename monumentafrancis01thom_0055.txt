citude than the care of the soul. Conseiously or not,
in the strict injunctions which he gave to his followers
to qualify themselves for his Order by an attendanee
on the leper hospitals and the visitation of the sick,

age. But, 111 thus qualifying themselves for working
among the large populations of the towns, the friars
were forced upon other studies, secondary only in im-
portanee to their main concern. Their early attention
to sickness and disease developed in the Order those
physical studies and pursuits for which they became
remarkable. With the friars came the first syste-
matic attention to medical studies and to natural
philosophy in general. Not as physics had been
studied before as part of an academical training 3—
but as theology under their treatment was humanized
by the necessity of their positi0n3 so physics, how-
ever feebly, were brought by them into contaet with
actual experiment. There is scarcely a writer of
eminence among them, distinguished as he may be
for logical and metaphysical ability, who is not
equally interested in experimenta] philosophy. I use
the word advisedly3 for many will be prepared to
admit the prevalence of physica] studies among the
schoolmen, and defeat the value of that admission‚
by assuming that the physics of that age were merely
subservient to scholastio logie. I repeat that the first
sustained attempts at experimental philosophy 60111-

in the case of Roger Bacon. But it would be equally
incorrect to overlook the experimental studies of other
schoolmen os Bacon’s age, as to overlook the scholastie
side of Roger Bacon’s own writings. The tendency of
