lxxviii PREFACE.
degree in theology at Oxford, Grostete had expressed
a desire of being present and presiding ab the cere-
111011γ.1 In his 33rd letter, Adam de Mariseo expresses
a hope that his brother Roberb may 106 admitted to
the priesthood by the iniposition of Grostete’s hands—-
ει requesb not likely to be refused. Like his brother,
1116 Archdeaeon was a 6111613 disciplinarian in ecclesi-
astical matters< ;2 110 small recommendation to the
friendship of Grostete.

Of Thomas, whom the writer styles a relative by
blood,3 and for whose interestis he interposes mone than
01166 111 these letters, no nobiee 0661116 elsewhere, nor
is it possible bo ascertain his rank or oeeupation froin
the references 111 this volume. He is onee4 mentioned
as the bearer of a letter from Grostete to Ethelmar²
Bishop of VVinehester, and the Prior of St. Swithin's

It might consequently 116 infer-red that he also was in

Grostete’s senice-'¹

¹ Giraldus Cambrensis, on a simi-
lar occasion, entertained the Uni-
vcrsity at a public banquct three
consecutive days.

² Matthew Puris, who is sar from
being uniformly partial to Grostete,
and could not forgive the Bishop for
his affection and liberality to the
Friars, accuses him of injustice for
giving Robert de Marisco the living
os Aylesbury. ‘⁵ Master Robert de
Weseham (he says), Dean of Lineoln,
n inan distinguished for his morals
and learning, was, chiefly at the
instance of 1116 Bishop of Lincoln‚
elected and appointed Bishop of
(joventi-y [1245] in the place of
william (le Montpellier. The
Bishop of Lincoln having thus ob·
tained 1116 object of his wishes,

ofAylesbury. as he had long wished

 

to do, from the deanery of Lineoln‚
(because he believed that the Dean
would prove refractory, owing to
the rich emoluments of the Chureh‚)
and he gave it to Master Robert de
Marsh‚ not without great injury to
the Church, which had been held
from time immemorial by the Dean
of Lincoln.” In an. 345, Weseham
had succeeded Grostete as divinity
