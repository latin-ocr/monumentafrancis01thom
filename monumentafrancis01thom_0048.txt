¹ In the answer by Thomas
Aquinas to the objections of Wil-
liam de St. Amour and others of
the Gallican clergy, we have a
brief summary of the complaints
made against the Mendicant Orders.
After referring in the outset to the
charge that mendicancy was con-
trary to Scriptum, he proceeds in,—

011. Ι. To a general vindication
of the religious orders and the vows
imposed by them. In

011. ΙΙ. He answers the objection
‘⁴ that the religious had no right to
teach.” In

Ch. 111. “That the religious had
no business to communicate with
secular persons in matters pertain-
ing to study; that there ought to
be no union of persons whose pur-
suits and occupations were so oppo-
site as those of the religious and the
seeular.’' 111

011. IV. “ That they had no right
to preach or hear confessions, as
having no licence sor so doing, or any
fixed cure.'' “It is a particular mark
of heresy‚” says St. Thomas, “ to sup-
press preaching in the Church.'' In

Ch. V. “That they were bound
to employ themselves in manual la-
bour, and when that was impossible,
in psalnis, prayers, and reading.” In

011. VI. ‘⁴ That for a person to 5811
1115 goods and enter a Mendicant
Order was contrary to Holy Scrip-
ture‚ unless he did 50 with a view
of supporting himself by manual
labour; because he despised what
God had given him, and exposed
himself to needless temptationS.’' In

Ch. VII. ‘⁶ That to live by alms
was contrary to Christianity, and
subtracted what was due to the poor.
It was, moreover, unmanly and illi-
beral.'’

He then proceeds to consider the
objections in Ch. VIII. made to the
sordid dress of the friars as indica-
tive of singularity. In

Ch. IX. Their intermeddling with
what did not concern them.

Ch. X. Their wandering from
place to place.

Ch. XI. Their devoting the time
to study and philosophy 3-——“ ever
learning and never coming to the
knowledge of the truth.'’

Ch. XII. Their study of eloquence
and method in the composition of
their sermons ; transgressing the
precept of the Apostle :—“ Not with
the wisdom ofwords.''—l 001. 1. 17.

Next he answers the complaints
made against them in

Ch. XIII. ‘⁶ That they com-
mended themselves and their omer,
and so were guilty of the sin of the
Pharisees.'’

Ch. XIV. “ That they resisted
their detractors.”

Ch. XV. “ That they appealed to
the civil tribunals.”

Ch. XVI. “That they punished
their persecutors.''

Ch. XVII. ⁶· That they sought to
please men.'’ And rejoiced

Ch. XVIII. ‘⁴ At the great things
God had wrought by them in the
conversion of others.”

Ch. XIX. ‘⁶ That they frequented
the courts of princes.” [Finany
