xlviii PREFACE.

cessfuL the Franciscan must be able to eope fairly with
those whom he wished to convert. In proportion as he
entered seriously on his task he found it requisite to
enforce the truths in which he felt interested, by con-
necting them with feelings and principles such as his
hearers would recognize and could understand. “ Non
accipit indoctus verint, scientias, 'nisi' prius ccc (limeris

From early times, therefore, the friars found it neces-

them in the hospital, or by the sympathy which he
displayed for their labour and their sufferings. But
his work was only half done—-it was but skin-
deep if he could not enter into their moral and

“ ties suitable to preaching.''' “ The reputation of the
“ English F riars increased 50 rapidly and their profi-

provinces, that Friar Helias, the minister-general, sent
“ sor Friar Philip Waleys and Friar Adam of York to ’
“ read lectures at Lyons.'' “ Readers,'’ he adds, “were
