and occupation, from fiunily and township ; he was
disqualified from approaching house or city ; deprived.
of all civil rights3 incapacitated from making a

to accoinplish thus much, no more3 leprosy like pau-
per-ism was made penal3 but the bitterest penalty
that man could inflict did not extinguish lepers or

¹ According to 1110 ancient law
of England, says ΜΡ. Hardy, in
his prefaee to 1110 “Close Rolls‚'’
p. xxxi. leprosy was an impedi-
ment to descent. A grant made

by a person after he fell sick of

the leprosy was void. Iu the
“ Abbrcviatio Placitorun1,'’ p. 19,
leprosy was pleaded and allowed
in the reign of King J0hn; and
the lund thereupon adjudged from
a leprous brother to the sister.
Even in the poor and inadequate
provision made for the lepor by the
charitable, the tone in which their
rules are conceived, show the total
degradation in which 1110 inseeted
was held. The pious benefactor to
the Lazar hospital of St. JuHan’s,
Hertford, Mon. ii. 376, begins thus :
-“Seeing that among all infirmities
the disease of the leprosy is more
disgusting than any, and they who
are visited with this disease‚ at all
times aud places ought to present
themselves in more humble garb
and gesture, as more contemptible

 

and humble than the rest of their
fellow men, according to the
words of 1110 Lord in Leviticus;
‘Whosoever 15 stained with the
leprosy shall rend his gai-ments
and go bare-headed,”’ &c-

“Yet ought they not on that
account to despair or murmur
against God, but rather to praise
and glorify Him who was led to
death as a leper, according to the
testimony of Isaiah‚ who says;
‘We did account him strieken of
God and afflicted,' calling to memory
the example also of J ob, who was
so smitten with the leprosy‚ ‘that
from the sole of his foot to the
crown of his head there was no
soundness in him‚” δια-11). 377.

It 15 enjoined among the rules
that if a married man entered the
hospital he should separate from his
wife and make a solemn vow of
chastity. He is not to stray beyond
bounds—not to touch anything in

the brew-housc or the baluz-house,
&c.
