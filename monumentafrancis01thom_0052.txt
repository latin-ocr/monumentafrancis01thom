xl rREFAcE.

marriage, how could woman be regarded with respect
or treated with honour, when a perfect state was con-
sidered incoinpatible with either? when a society, built
up on an abnegation not 01“ marriage only, but of all
family ties, was represented as of Divine institution, and
all civil societies, all human institutions as exclusively
secular, without sanctity, without God's authority?
The Franciscan could not meet the evil completely.
He was bound to celibacy—for of any society, without
such an indispensable condition, no reformer in the
middle ages ever conceived the possibility—but he did
what he could to counteract the inischief. He insisted
on the humanity of the Son of God; he dwelt on
His poverty and sufferings as a man, He exalted the
condition of woman by exalting the Virgin Mother.
He insisted on her spotless purity, on her maternal
authority and dignity, on her mysterious fellowship with
her Son, 011 1161· joys and sorrows. Doubffless, it was
his anxiety to bring out those facts in her history
more prominently, that induced the friar to give
greater prominence to the childhood than to the man-
hood of Christ, to lay greater stress on the parent, to
exalt the Mother at the expense of the Son. Un-
doubtedly also the favour with which these doctrines were
received by the people‚ tempted the friar to carry them
to extravagant lengths, to degrade them by gross,
sensualized iinages and representations which lost him
the influence he had once possessed, and turned all
reverence for him into ridicule and conteinpt.1
