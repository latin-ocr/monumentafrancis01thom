‘· by the excellence of wisdom that they who are
“ obstinate in malice can alone be repressed, and they

So theology, which at one time was in danger of
being banished from 1110 universities and superseded
by the more popular and promising studies of Aristotle
and the Canonists, returned to its pristine dignity.
There was no danger now of the Aristotelia-n dialectics

Aristotle was to be reconciled with Revelatiom not Reve-
