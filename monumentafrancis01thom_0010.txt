The works to be published in octaVO‚ separately‚ as
they were finished3 the whole responsibility of the task
resting upon the editors, who were to be chosen by the
Master of the Rolls with the sanction of the T reasury.

The Lords of Her Majesty's Treasury, after a careful
consideration of the subject, expressed their opinion in a
T reasury Minute, dated February 9, 1857, that the plan
recommended by the Master of the Rolls “was well
calculated for the accomplishment of this important
national object, in an effectual and satisfactory manner,
within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention be
paid to economy, in making the detailed arrangementS,
without unnecessary expense.’'

They expressed their approbation of the proposal that
each chronicle and historical document should be edited
in such a manner as to represent with all possible correct-
ness the text of each writer, deriVed from a collation of the
best MSS„ and that no notes should be added, except
such as were illustrative of the various readings. They
suggested, however, that the preface to each work should
contain, in addition to the particulars proposed by the
Master of the Rolls, a biographical account of the author,
so far as authentic materials existed for that purpose, and
an estimato of his historical credibility and value.

In compliance with the order of the Treasury, the
Master of the Rolls has selected for publication for the
plesent year such works as he considered best calculated
to fill up the chasms existing in the printed materials of
English history and of these work s the plesent is one.
