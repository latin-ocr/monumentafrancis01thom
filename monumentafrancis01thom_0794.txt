W1L111m1 DE BEAUCHAMP.
See p. 286.

This William Beauchamp of Bedford, son of Simon, a nobleman
of great power and authority, had adhered to the barons in the wars
against King John. “And as,'’ says Dugdale, “this William de
“ Beauchamp had been an active person in those turbulenta times
‘⁶ against King John, so did he continue against King Henry the
“ Third, as is manifest from his being taken prisoner in the Battle
‘⁵ of Lincoln, 1 Η. III. But submitting to obedience before the end
⁴‘ of that year, as most did, 116 had restitution of his lands, which
‘⁶ were seised upon for that trangression.

“ In 2 Hen. 111„ he paid sixty-one pounds sixteen shillings, upon
“ levying the first scutage of that King, for those forty-five knights
“ fees and a half, a fifth and twelfth part, which he then held,
“ and was the same year in the King’s army at Newark.

“ In 7 Hen. III., being with other great men in that expedition
“ then made into VVales, he had scutage of all his tenants in the
“ counties of Middlesex, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Bucking-
“ hamshire, Huntingdonshire‚ and Berkshire‚ and deserved so well
‘⁶ for that service, that the next year following, after the King
“ had caused the castle of Bedford to be wholly demolished‚ and
‘⁶ the ditches thereos to be filled up, he obtained a patent for the
‘⁶ site thereof, with liberty to erect a mansion upon it, and to in-
“ close it with a wall, not exceeding the height of that which
‘⁸ was for the lesser ward, but to be without any battlement.

“ In 10 Hen. III., being in the King's army at Grosmund in VVales,
‘⁶ against Richard, Earl Marshal, then in rebellion, he suffered
“ with the rest of the King’s forces, who were, by a sudden sur-
“ prise from the Welsh‚ despoiled of all they had there.

‘⁶ In 19 Hen. 111„ he was constituted Sheriff for the Counties of
‘⁶ Buckingham and Bedford, in which year he obtained a charter
“ to himself, and Ida his wife, who was the King’s cosin, that
“ the Mannor of Newport, of her dowry, should thenceforth be
“ exempt from suit to the county, or Hundred Court, aid to the
“ sheriff, and view of Frank-pledge.

‘⁶ 111 20 Hen. III„ at the solemn nuptials of that King, he per-
“ formed the office of almoner for the same day. And in 21
‘⁶ Hen. ΙΙΙ. executed the office of sheriff for the counties of Bed-
“ ford and Buckingham.
