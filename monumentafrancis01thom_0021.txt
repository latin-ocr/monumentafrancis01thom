PREFACE.

IJ-OF THE ΕΒΑ EMBRACED IN THE WORK.

OUR volume commences with the arrival and settle-
mcnt, of the Franciscan‚¹ Millorite, 01· Gray Friars in
England, in 1226, two years before the deaffli of their
founder, Si. Francis, in the Oth year of the reign of
Hen1·y HL, and of Honorius HL, successor to Pope
Innocenb III.

It was a sbirring and imporbanb epoch in the history Infidplten-
of Europe. When ‘ohe policy of Innocenb III. see111edss¹vegssfffissfie
on 'ohe eve of being crowned with succeSS‚ a new and 13111 een-
more potent influence had sbarbed up to threaten the tury.

provided for all other colitingencie33 noh for nbis.

‘Franciscam from the founder’s

name, Gray Friars, from the colour ¹
of their habit‚—Minores or Mino- ’

rites, as the youngest and humblest

of the religious foundations. The ‘¹
last title has given birth to many l
speculations ; but sce p. 565 of this ι

volume. Later writers of the Order
are fond of a pious quibble on the
word.

dicet adhuc, ‘Minor sum.⁹ Si
David, ‘Mendicus sum et pauper,
immo, vermis sum, et non lzomo‚'
