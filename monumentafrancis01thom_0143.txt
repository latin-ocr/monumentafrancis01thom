CCXIII. To W. OF No'riNGHAM - - - ’Pa-{5⁶26

'l'hat the bishop of Lincoln entered Lyons during
Epiphany in excellent health and was honour-
ably received by the Pope and the Cardi-
nals.—The Pope has promised him favour,
but the event is uncertain. —A general
council will be held on the 24th of June,
at which the bishop intends to be present.—
There is some talk of sending a mission
of the friars minor to the Holy Land and
to T artary 3—certain English friars are named
for that purpose—Adam, the writer, and friar
John have been well received.—Expect that
the friars will be hardly treated by the bishops
at the forthcoming counci13--they arc not in
favour at Court.--Conjectures that certain
friars will be invited to attend—Begs him to
send the Moralia of St. Gregory, Rabanus
Maurus, and the First Prophecies [of Ab.
J oachim ?]—Desires his remembrance to certain
friars at home.

attention.
