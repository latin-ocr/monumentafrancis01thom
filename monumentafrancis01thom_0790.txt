“Another instance occurred not far from Oxford, at the new set-
tlement of the Friars there. There was a knight who hated their
mode of life, and had used them bitterly‚ blackening their good name
whenever an opportunity offered. It happened on Christmas day
that he who ruled over the Friars assembled them to sow the saving
seed of the Lord in the land. As two of them were going into
a neighbouring wood, picking their way along the rugged path
over the srozen mud and rigid snow, whilst the blood lay in the
track of their naked feet without their perceiving it, the junior
said to the elder, ‘ Father, shall I sing, and lighten our journey2’
and on leave being granted, he thundered forth a Salve Reqina
misericordice. It so chanced that the soldier, by no means
in good humour with them, was following the same mad, without
their knowledge. Now when the hymn was concluded, as the
soldier saw the prints of the blood from their naked feet in the
wood, he who had been the consoler said with a sort of self-con-
gratulation to his companion, ‘ Brother, was not that antiphona] well
sung ῗ-” Whereupon the soldier, breaking in upon their talk, ‘Yes,
by the Lord, it was; and may the Lord bless and prosper you,
who, like the Apostles, are patient in necessities, and rejoice in tri-
bulation.' And at this word he slipped from his horse, and asked
pardon on 1115 knees for the harsh judgrnents 116 had passed upon
tliein.”-Cln'on. de Lanercost, p. 31.

“At Oxford lies Friar Agnellus de Pisis. He was the first rni-
nister in England; glorious for 1115 life and his miracles. He was
the first who built a convent at Paris, and was Custos there. Whilst
he was only a deaeon he would not advance to priest's orders with-
out licence from a general chapter. He was eventually appointed
by St. Francis the first Minister to England, and sent there with
four brethren, in which number was Friar Albertus de Pisis, who,
after Agnellus‚ was Minister of England, and was indeed third
General Minister after St. Francis. “

“This Friar Agnellus‚ with his aforesaid 6001116010115, going to
Englemd, entered that land on the third day of May, and were
received at Canterbury most devoutly, in the bowels of charity,
by the Friars Preaehers who dwelt there. Then wishing to go
to Oxford, about eventide they arrived at a grange belonging to
the Monks of Ambidon (Abingdon)‚ in a vast wood between Bath
