DisrcTE RESPECTING THE Hosprmt IN SOUTHWARK.
See p. 337.

In the year 1252, about the octaves of St. Martin [Nov. 18.]‚ a
priest intruded himself into the wardenship of St. Thomas's Hospital‚
in Southwark, with the consent of the Bishop of VVinchester, in
whose diocese that hospital stands. But Master Eustace de Len, the
Archbishop's official, considering his dignity affronted, because his
consent ought first to have been asked in reference to the patr-onage,
admonished the priest to retire, once, twice, and a third time. The
priest, who is also the prior, refused, sticking fast to possession.
The official excommunicates him on the ground of contumacy, and
under this sentence the prior remained for forty days, redoubling
his threats and his abuse. The official considering such pride
to be intolerable, commanded the priest to be arrested as a con-

church, in his sacerdotal vestments, but the Officers sent to appre-

and had done despite to the keys of the church. So the official
gave orders that he should be brought to Maidstone, a manor

fered a very grievous affront, he made a complaint to his brethren.
Elated by their aid and advice, he assembled a band of soldiers,
and with a large company at his heels, sent them in quest of the
authors of this violence, intending to have them arrested. With a
mighty fury and tumult they came in hostile array to Southwark,
expecting to find the guilty party. But after they had pried into
every hole and corner, without any result, they hurried off to Maid-
stone, resolving to liberate the prior, detained there as a prisoner.
Breaking bars and bolts, and examining every corner, as they could
not discover the object of their search, who had been carefully
stowed away, they called for fire, proposing to burn the whole
place to ashes. After much mischief done, not finding him whom
they were in quest of, and hearing from some tale-bearer in
