their own rights before ine, not in tempor-al matters, but the sal-
vation of souls, arising from their inhabiting the said place, und
that in such a cause, as they alleged, ordinary law and right must
give way to the salvation of souls3 yet because (as the sanie brother
asserted) their profession is the gospel, which bids us not to resist
evil, but to him that strikes us on the right eheek to olsei- the
other also, and because the authority of St. >Paul requires us rather
to be defrauded than to sti-ive,—therefore they would freely recede
from their right, and abandon the place which had given 'occasion
to this dispute, forbearing the least offence to you, whom they
regard as their most holy fathers and abundant benefactors. And
the same brother, prostrating himself at the fect of your proetor
and others of your fraternity then present before us, humbly
requested pardon for his Order‚ inasmuch as for two days of the
trial the foresaid friars‚ guided by the spirit of evil counsel, had, as
it were, in defence of their own right, offended your charity. The
proctor also of the said friars of Scarborough ratifying the same,
expressly renounced on their behalf the foresaid exemption and
privilege, and all other defences thereto belonging. But we,¹
with your proctor and others of your fraternity then present, con-
sidering, or rather being assured, that if the aforesaid friars should
hereupon depart from Searborough, as according to the assertion
of their proctor they professed themselves with all humility prc-
pared to do, it would not redound to the credit of your Order.
but rather blacken your reputation, as your discretion, without any
suggestion on my part, may readily understand, with the advice
and assent of your said proetor and fraternity have tolerated the
stay of the Friars Minors of Searborough in that place, until we
had given you notice of the premises, and received your determi-
nation by Letters Patent as to their abiding there, or their departure
froin the same, &0.”—Brown’s Fasc. ii. 383.
