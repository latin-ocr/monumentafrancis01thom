understanding, their method ensured success to that
appeal: it bound the understanding, if it did not
satisfy 11 hig-her faculty, of which the 00110011111111 and
the preacher took 110 cognizancc, and neither professed
nor attempted to satisfy. On the whole, the spirit of
Lord Bacon’s remark 10 just:

“ This 0111110 unprofitable subtilty or curiosity 10 of
“ two sorts: either 011 1110 subject 110011 which they ”
(the schoohnen) “ handle, when it 10 a fruitless specu-

let, where the syllogistic conceits of

the natural mind are brought into
ludicrous, but somewhat pathetic,
contrast with the inductive mind and
deeper feeling of Hamlet‚ sick and
becoming still sicklier by the useless
pursuit of vain analogies. In thus
Setting before us the two intellectual
phases‚ in their weakness‚ shak-
speare shows us how the mind
of the fellow gravedigger‚ over-
awed as he is by the magio of
logie is not free from an uneasy

feeling that all is not quite fair; his
judgment is trammeled3 but he is
not convinced. His stolid wonder-
ment is contrasted with the equally
stolid common sense of Horatio,
referring to his own sensuous tri-
bunal the supersensuous flights of
his companion3 guaging by his
inch of plumb-line the unfathom-
able, confused abyss of the other’s
thoughts, and declaring that there
is nothing in them. It is a history
in little of inductive and deductiva
philosophy.
