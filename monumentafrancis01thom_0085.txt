PREFACE. lxxiii

And this is sufficienb to disprove 1116 absurd statement,
of Bale, who places him in the reign of Edward III.y
a blunder heedlessly followed by Pia, Tanner, and
others. The progress of exaggeration is exemplified in
this noborious biographer. After quoting Leland's
account of Ecclestom which he has curbailed of ex-
pressions 100 favourable 10 the Friar, Bale thus pro-
ceeds: “Opus esf, ad instar libri Conformita'oum
‘⁴ Bartholomaei Pisani, 11661, quantibabe minus, fabulis,
“ mendaciis ac blasphemiis plenum. Tractat, enim
“ de Francisci tunica, chorda, vulneribus eb braccis,
“ de primis fratrum exordiis in Anglia‚ de absti-
“ nenbiis, jejuniis, ciliciis, vigiliis, castrationibus vel
“ emasculationibus, aedificiis, precibus horariis, visio-
“ nibus, portentis, prodigiis, slzudiis² docbrinis 61 166-
“ turis. Absolubumque opus hoc Simoni Essebio amico
“ 61, ejus ordinis professori dedicavit.'’ It mighss almosb
be doubbed whether Leland and Bale were speaking of
one and 1116 same work, bub for the notorious disregard
of ‘ohe 161161· to sti-iob veracity, Whenever an opportunity
occurred for venting his hatred against 1116 religious
orders. To 1116 same suspicions authority we owe 1116
6656111011 thal, Eccleston was 1116 author of a work in
1269 agains‘o 1116 Dominicans, entiffled De Impugyoza-
tione per Dominiccmos, and he adds, ‘⁶ atque alia coa-
“ gessit, sed ejusdem omnino saporis3 iba 111, ex his
“ nihil aliud professi videantur quam scenicam quandam
“hypocrisim ac merum quaestum.'’ It is, however,
scarcely worth while to 611161 upon a serious refuta-
tion of a writer whose judgmenb and accuracy bore no
proportion 10 his prejudices.¹
Ecclesbon’s work sully bears 0111 'ohe character it subject Of

has received from Leland. It is 1116 produc‘oion of alus work.
simple-minded, single-hearted friar, who entertains no

Dominicans in 1269 and flourish in the reign of Edward ΙΙΙ. 2
