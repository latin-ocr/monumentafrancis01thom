XXX PREFACE.

In the letters of Adam de Mai-isco the reader will see
other instances of the penuriousness of the general
ministers, and their reluctance to furnish the members
of their Order engaged in teaching and lecturing with
the requisite means for study.

Forbidden On one occasion a provincial minister wished to

him the sense of the words, ⁴‘ Take nothing with you
“ on the way.'' NVas it absolutely nothing? ‘⁶ No-
“ thing,’² said St. Francis, “ except the habit allowed
