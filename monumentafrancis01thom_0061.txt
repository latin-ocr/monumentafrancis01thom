“ and Oxfo1·d; and the gift of wisdom so overssowed
“ in the province of England, that before the depo-
“ sition of W illiam of Notinghasm there were as
“ many as thirty lecturcrs 111 England, and a regular
“ 311000331011 of them was provided in the Univer-
“ sities.'’

Hitherto the formal method of instruction adopted which thus
10 1110 Universities embraced the old division of studies ῗξΐέΐῗᾶἓίζ

theology stood the highest. For the lecturer in that
science, the Sentences of Peter Lombcml¹ formed the
ordinary text-book. Following the method there laid

his instructions to 1113 own taste or the wants and
capacities of his hearers. He was bound to no
other restriction. The uniformity thus preserved in

all that had been said on both sides. From an
anecdote in Eccleston2 we learn that the student
took 110103, which he reproduced in the form of a
lecture. The exercise varied by disputations between
the professor and the candidate, brought into play
those faculties of readiness, inemory‚ and invention,
