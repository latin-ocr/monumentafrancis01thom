Earl of Montfort’s ruin to Glouces-
ter's treachery, and to Prince Ed-
ward's facility in making promises
whilst in adversity, which he did
not intend to keep in prosperity.
Thus a contemporary poet addresses

“ O Comes Gloverniae comple quod
coepisti;
Nisi claudas congrue multos dece-
pisti.
Age nunc viriliter sicut promisisti3
Causam fave fortiter cujus fons
fuisti.

Si, quod absit! subtrahas manum
et levamen,
Terrae fraudem faciens, inferens
gravamen,
Maledictus maneas ! fiat ! fiat!

lection, in a poem on the Battle of
Lewes, re· echoing precisely the sen-
timents expressed by Adam de Ma-
risco says of Prince Edward:—
‘ Cum in arcto suerit quicquid vis
promittit,
Sed mox ut evaserit promissum
dimittit 3
Testis sit Glovernia, ubi quod ju-
ravit,
Liber ab angustia statim revo-

eavit!
Ib. p. 94.
