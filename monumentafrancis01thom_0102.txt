XC PREFACE.

thwarted in their attempts to enforce discipline by the
conflicting jurisdiction of king's court and papa] court,
or bewildered by the irreconcilable dicta of canonist and
civilian,—left matters to proceed as they would, with
here and there only a noble exception. It was hard

as they will. I 0111 30 depressed that scarcely any
