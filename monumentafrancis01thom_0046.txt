xxxiv PREFACE.
“ ledge than he works, and 116 15 a wise man only
“ in the degree in which 110 loves God and his neigh-
“ bour.”¹

Their A style of preaching, founded on meditation and

ξέζὲἓξέιῃὲἒ experience, was precisely adapted to 'ohe requirements

experience. of those classes of the community for whose improve-
ment and welfare St. Francis felt the (leepesb sym-
pathy. Considering the cducation and logical studies
of the secular clergy in those (lays, it is not easy to
discover how they could have made themselves intel-

ligible to the ordinary population of the towns3 still 1655,

111111; a pen-case, seal, and writing
materials‚ his associates. He is not
10 116 an accumulator of books 3 not
very intent upon reading, for sear
that he should derogate from his
office the time he devotes to study.
He shall piously comfort the afflicted,
lest, as hc is their ultimate refuge
in trouble, if they find not relies and
remedy from him, the discase of de·
speration should grow too strong for
1116111. To win the perverse and
proud to meekness, let him humblc
himself, and abate somewhat of his
own right to gain a soul. To the
runaways of his Order let him open
the bowels of mercy, as to sheep
that have been lost; let him never
refuse to pardon them, well knowing
that their temptations are very
strong, and if the Lord permitted
him to be tried 116 might perchance
fall worse than they. As the vicar
of Christ, I would have him ho-
noured with devout reverence by
all, and that provision be made for
him by all, and in all things with
all benevolenee‚ in proportion to the
exigence of his need and the suita-

 

bleness of our state. He ought not to
be exalted by honours and favours
shown him more than he is delighted
by injuries, or to let honours change
his manners, except for the better.
If ever he requires more ample or
generous fare, let him not take it in
secret, but openly. To him it ap-
pertains to discern the secret con-
science, and elicit the truth from
hidden veins. Therefore, let him
regard all accusations with suspi-
cion at first, until the truth shall be
known by diligent inquiry. Let him
give no heed 1ο gossipers, and parti-
cularly suspect all accusations pro-
ceeding from such persons, and be
slow to credit them. Let him not
from desire of retaining popularity‚
refuse or relax the forms os justice
and equity ; nor, on the other hand,
let him suffer souls to perish from
over much rigorz let not torpor
arise from excessive kindness‚ nor
the relaxation of discipline from
over indulgence3 and so let him be
feared by all who love, and loved
by all who sear him.‘' . Ib. i., p. 90.
