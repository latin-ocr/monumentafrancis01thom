PREFMJE. XXV

“ the leper. He was 11 lepor all over, disgustiug fm-
“his open ulcers; especially as 1110 fingers were
“ covered with sores and blood3 insomuch that as
“ he dipped his fingers in the dish and carried the
“ morsels to his mouth, the gore and blood dripped
“ into the dish. As the friars looked 011 they were
“ greatly grieved and pained at ,the sight. But for
‘⁴ the reverence they 11010 111111, 1100 0110 01011001 utter
“ a word.

“ He that saw these things 11010 record of 0110111 and
“ wrote them.”

Again, in the same work,l 1110 solicitude for this for-
]orn and unhappy class is thus manifested. “ He ap-
“ pointed‚’' says the author, “ that the friars of his
“ order, dispersed in various parts of the world, should
“ for the love of Christ diligently attend the lepers
“ wherever they could 110 found. They followed this
“ injunction with the greatest promptitude. Now there
“ was in a certain place a leper so impatient, fro-
“ ward, and impious that every one thought he was
“ possessed by an evil spirit. He abused all that
served him with 001111110 0010110 and imprecatione,
“ often proceeding to blows. What was still more
fearful, he uttered 0110 0111000 blasphemy against
“ Christ, and His most holy Mother‚ and the
“ holy angels. The friars endured 01110 ill-usage
“ patient1y3 but they could not tolerate 1110 101010-
“ phemies3 they felt they ought 1100, and therefore
“ they resolved to abandon the leper to his fate3
“ having first taken counsel with St. Francis. Brother
“ Francis visited the leper‚ and upon entering the room
“ said to him, in the usual salutation: ‘ The Lord
‘⁶ ‘give thee peace, brother.’ ‘ What peace‚' exclaimed
“ the leper, ‘ can Ι have, who am entirely diseased2’
